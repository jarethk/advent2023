Part 1 - They really hand you the answer on this one.  For every set of numbers create a stack of reduced number sets with the difference, then walk that stack back adding the new end numbers.

Part 2 - Same verse, except adding the new end numbers we subtract the new front numbers.  Too easy for Day 9.
