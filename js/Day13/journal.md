Part 1 - wow did this take too many attempts at the logic.  I kept thinking of different ways to deal with and check the mirroring.  In the end I used slice on the grid, took two equal sized slices from each potential point, and compared the slices.  This after attempting too many search algorighms.  At least I got to use parts of my geometry/space2d library to handle the grid rotation, though I also had to update that to deal with grids that are not equal x/y lengths.

Part 2 - instead of straight comparison of the slices, I need to find slices where the difference is exactly 1 character.  This one was easier, and I created a couple handy methods to help for zippering two arrays, comparing zippered arrays, flat-mapping arrays of strings, and counting the differences of those.
