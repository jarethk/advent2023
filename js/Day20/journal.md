Part 1 - input processing, need to keep some info on each command module, and logic for signal translation.

Part 2 - wow what a mess.  First I tried brute force, which would have taken too long.  So I decide to do some analysis on the operators, and track some of the processing changes after a couple button presses.  Then I get the smart idea, realizing that it all hinged on the periodicity of the 4 inputs to the final state, so I just need to see when each of those would get the right state.  Didn't work.  Why? Simple mistakes.  So I get distracted thinking about other solutions, before coming back to finding the periodicity of those 4 states and see my coding error.  A quick fix, an lcm reducer, and the whole thing processes in almost no time.  I left all my notes and trial code in for ha-ha's.
